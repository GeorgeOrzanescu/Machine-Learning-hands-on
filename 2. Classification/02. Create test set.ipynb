    "### This is very quickly done in the book , but some important thinks to remember:\n",
    "    - You should always create a test set and set it aside before inspecting the data closely.\n",
    "    - MNIST dataset is actually already split into a training set (the first 60,000 images) and a test set (the last 10,000 images)\n",
    "    - The training set is already shuffled for us, some learning algorithms are sensitive to the order of the training instances, and they perform poorly if they get many similar instances in a row. Shuffling the dataset ensures that this won’t happen;\n",
