    "    - 2. y_prediction = model.predict(x_test) : model predicts labels ( captured in y_prediction) based on only the attributes in the test set\n",
    "    - 3. model.score(x_test,y_test)  : we want a score for the predictions to see how accurate the model is. So this method checks base on the test set data. U don't need to pass the y_prediction to the score() function because that is already done internally . \n",
